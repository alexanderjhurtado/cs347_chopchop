You can run the script by calling `python3 script.py FILENAME` where `FILENAME` is the path to the raw video file you want to generate action clips for (e.g. `python3 script.py raw.MOV`). All action clips will be saved to the `action_clips` directory, and all transition clips to the `transition_clips` directory.

All pip dependencies are located in `requirements.txt` -- you can simply run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to get the right libraries.
